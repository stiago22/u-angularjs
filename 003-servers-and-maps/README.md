# 003 - Servers and Maps

The Purpose of this example it's to understand how to interact with servers in a real life application, we will work with a [Open Wheater API][1] to retrive our data, also a little introduction about [ui-leaflet][2] and [Angular Materials][3], and we are going to cover the following subjects: 

*  Data Services and Factories
* `$http` and `$resource`
* `ui-leaflet`
* `$mdDialog`

### To Do
Perform the following in the current example:
* Capture the map click [event][4], and get the [lat,lng].
* Bring the [Weather][5] or [UV][8] of the location selected.
* Place a [marker][6] in the locaton selected.
* Promp a modal using `$mdDialog` [service][7], to show the weather data.
